# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- My motivation for this study guide is to be able to reference it and add to it as I continue my bootcamp to ensure I keep all of these tools ready and available in my toolbelt. 
- I built this project to help others and myself to remember the big and small things when learning to code. I can use this study guide for reference when debugging to help ensure I am executing coding steps covering HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
- This guide helps to remember all the tools that the UT bootcamp provides. With the massive amount of information, it is impossible to remember everything and these notes will be available to fall back on and reference to help provide confidence in coding projects whether working on them solo or within a group.
- I learned a great deal about the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. I learned to structure a site properly using HTML and how to style it with CSS. I also learned how to use commands in GitBash as well as link an SSH to my GitHub like a professional developer. Effectively using JavaScript I was able to learn the value of using for Loops and Arrays as well as adding functions.
